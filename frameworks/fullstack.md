      - level: 1
        criteria:
          - 'Scope: ‚úÖ Task'
          - 'Summary: A new engineer, with high potential, picking up the fundamentals they need to be successful in their squad.'
          - 'Level 1 engineers are at the start of their software engineering career. They‚Äôre working on well-defined tasks and are supported by the team when stuck. They‚Äôre expected to ask lots of questions! As someone progresses toward Level 2 they should start to gain confidence to pick up larger or less well-defined tasks with less required support.'
      - level: 2
        criteria:
          - 'Scope: ‚úÖ Task'
          - 'A productive and reliable engineer working effectively within a squad.'
          - 'Level 2 defines engineers who have learned the ropes, and are building the foundation to being solid contributors at Upp.'
          - 'Level 2 engineers are focussed on tasks assigned to their team, typically working with the support of other engineers to reliably deliver these.'
          - 'We expect all Level 1 and Level 2 engineers at Upp to show positive trajectory towards Level 3, and generally expect people to progress from 2 to 3 within the course of 1-2 years at Upp.'
          - 'Accepts feedback graciously.'
          - 'Gives feedback to peers when asked.'
        exampleCriteria:
          - criteria: 'Provides helpful and actionable feedback in code reviews in an empathetic manner'
            examples:
              - 'Take a look at the levelling up your code reviews talk for some ideas'
          - criteria: 'Writes PR descriptions that provide context and provide rationale for significant decisions'
            examples:
              - 'I decided to X instead of Y here, I also considered Z but for these reasons I went with X'
      - level: 3
        criteria:
          - 'Scope: üé® Project or feature'
          - 'A strong contributor. Responsible for the entire lifecycle of a project or feature.'
          - 'Level 3 defines a solid contributor at Upp, able to take on any technical problem related to their discipline or domain confidently, and can clearly articulate how they‚Äôre working with others to help their team reach its goals. While we don‚Äôt expect any engineer to work alone, Level 3 engineers are highly independently capable, and can lead on the design and implementation of a feature or project.'
          - 'A Level 3 engineer not only delivers their own work, but also demonstrates the ability to bring up others around them, for example, through activities such as onboarding engineers into their team, or mentoring less experienced engineers working with them.'
          - 'They‚Äôre engaged in the challenges, opportunities and risks faced by their squad, collective and discipline ‚Äì taking part in the initiatives where they‚Äôre best placed to help.'
          - 'Our expectation is that all Upp engineers are capable of reaching Level 3 within an appropriate timescale (see previous levels), but they may not wish to take on additional responsibilities beyond this level, and that‚Äôs OK. Progression through level 3 to level 4 would usually take up to 2 years experience, as a guide.'
          - 'Suggest ways on enhancing pair programming experience.'
          - "Transparent about mistakes they've made, early."
          - 'Proactively gives timely actionable feedback to peers.'
          - 'Proactively seeks feedback from the people around them.'
          - 'Considers the opinions of others before defending their own.'
      - level: 4
        criteria:
          - 'Scope: üë• Team or Domain'
          - 'An experienced contributor, leading in a team or domain area.'
          - 'The scope and impact of a Level 4 engineer is typically felt at the team or domain level, with their influence beginning to spread wider across the business. It should be clear to see how a Level 4 engineer has contributed to a team achieving their goals for a quarter.'
          - 'The engineer brings distinct individual strengths, is self-aware of what these are, and are impactful through these.'
          - "In the past, progression to Level 4 focused heavily on leadership abilities. We‚Äôre keen to recognise that impact at this scale can be made in various ways (including by more generalist engineers), and that there are different 'shapes' of engineer at Level 4. Depending on the individual situation, someone may skew more heavily towards certain behaviours and technical skills than others."
          - 'At one end of the continuum we have the tech lead, who excels at leading engineering in their team, effectively working with other disciplines such as product and design, or stakeholders such as finance and data analysts. Whilst they may be involved in running rituals, their impact is felt more around the engineering culture they foster through their work: tech leads cultivate the design of performant systems that scale and meet customer needs, encouraging and supporting their team to build software that is high quality and tested sufficiently. It‚Äôs important to note that some engineers may wear the tech lead hat before they reach Level 4, but not yet be meeting the level expectations in other ways; L4 and tech lead are not synonymous.'
          - 'The other end of the scale has the domain expert, who is a collective or company wide subject matter expert in one or more areas of our platform, whether that‚Äôs a set of complex services or problems, such as Google Ads API, or a particular technology such as Kafka. The domain expert drives technology forward for Upp, and is typically the person to lead on systems design in that area, sharing proposals to level up others with their work.'
          - "In between will be people who are technically competent, excellent team members and highly productive but none of whom are a specific 'expert' in a particular thing or want to be a tech lead."
          - 'Level 4 is a challenging step up from Level 3, and with it comes new responsibilities and expectations. Not every engineer will be capable of, or want to reach Level 4, but Upp will always need engineers at this level and there will be opportunities to progress to this point should someone be willing and able. To progress through this level will likely take 2-3 years. '
          - "Proactively gives feedback 'upwards' and to people they interact with who are not in their team."
          - 'Transparent in making design and technical decisions.'
          - 'Helps people in non-technical roles understand technical constraints / trade-offs.'
          - 'Shares technical context and direction for less experienced engineers.'
          - 'Gives direct and constructive feedback to other engineers.'
      - level: 5
        criteria:
          - 'Scope: üç± Collective or Discipline'
          - 'A highly experienced leader, leading in a large domain or collective.'
          - 'Staff and Senior Staff are senior leadership ‚ÄúDirector Level‚Äù roles within Upp. The engineer should be highly confident in the role that they can personally play to be instrumental in helping Upp achieve our collective and business goals. They do this by focusing on high impact, high value work which likely involves our largest and most ambiguous problems, and by breaking down large long-term projects and mobilising teams to deliver them.'
          - 'As an engineer they‚Äôre a technical authority at Upp, with influence and respect across multiple squads, disciplines and projects.'
          - 'They proactively drive cross-team initiatives, championing our engineering principles and guiding others through pragmatic technical choices and trade-offs. They actively help lead engineering technology strategy for their Collective or Discipline, not only in the present, but for the future.'
          - 'Progression to Level 5 will be possible for many engineers at Upp, but the opportunities to do so will be more limited, taking into account their discipline and area of the company.'
          - 'Helps other people develop themselves and regularly gives insightful, useful feedback to those around them.'
          - 'Talks to non-technical stakeholders on appropriate level of abstraction.'
      - level: 6
        criteria:
          - 'Scope: üè¶ Company'
          - 'An engineering leader having impact across a broad area of the company, wider than a single collective or discipline.'
          - 'As a Level 6 engineer an engineer will be leading on technical initiatives which directly address Upp‚Äôs most important needs, beyond a single Collective or Discipline. To do this, they‚Äôll be setting high level vision and strategy, and directly using their engineering knowledge and abilities to create solutions to our most challenging problems.'
          - 'They‚Äôre respected by both the wider Upp engineering community, and the industry at large, because their past impact speaks for itself, both from work where they‚Äôve been involved directly, and through appropriately working through others.'
          - 'To move to and progress through Level 6 they‚Äôll be on an individual journey and their progression and goals will be very bespoke.'
          - 'These will be agreed with their line manager and other senior leaders around the business. There will be a difference between an engineer being a general L6, and one who is doing a very specific job (e.g. Architecture). Progression to L6 is not a given, and depends on having a specialism or unique skill that is critical to the company.'
          - 'Transparent about feedback they have received and what they are going to do differently.'

### About our engineering progression frameworks

This is an evolution of our engineering progression framework. This document is a perpetual work-in-progress and will never be "done". There are a few guiding pillars for engineering progression at Upp:

- We will focus on the impact an individual engineer can have on driving Upp forwards, rather than specific behaviours.

- Scope is an additional measure for different levels of seniority. As Upp grows, so should the size or reach of the problems we encounter as engineers.

- We have aimed to consolidate behaviours down into essentials. This framework does not intend to be an exhaustive list of everything an engineer does or can do, but instead articulate the important distinctions between levels.

- Behaviours should be broad enough to factor in the numerous different ways an engineer can contribute effectively. As an example: we should not list specific tasks such as "writes complex event sourcing service" but instead articulate the standards of technical contribution we should expect from engineers of different levels. As a result, our framework will need more interpretation, and is likely to be ineffective when used independently without your manager. **We do not wish to create an exercise that can be "check boxed" to completion**.

- We wish to do away with levelling exercises or calculations. Attempting to boil performance and progression down to numbers and equations is lazy and leaves little room for the different ways engineers can add value. Instead, we rely on managers to clearly articulate how an engineer is meeting the scope and impact of each level, and that they are aligning with our technical principles as a company.

- We do not wish to have separate frameworks for each discipline. Our framework should focus on the practice of engineering itself; it should not matter which programming language you choose to use.

Levels are cumulative. Particularly within the technical skill and behaviours categories, we expect engineers to be demonstrating the contents of previous levels in addition to their own level. As an example: We expect level 3 engineers to also be proactively testing their work, despite this being a level 2 behaviour.

_The framework is a compass, not a GPS_.

### How does it work?

The framework covers all the things we‚Äôre looking for from engineers at Upp. We‚Äôre interested in these five elements:

#### - Impact - The size, scope and value of what you deliver

Impact is the main driver for progression at Upp. Put simply, impact measures your sphere of influence and individual input on our success as a business, through contributing to Upp‚Äôs mission and goals. The area of the business you work in may mean you can have impact in different ways - for instance through contributing to growth, helping with efficiency or cost reduction, meeting regulatory requirements, or more. You may also have impact in other indirect ways, for example improving engineering practices, or helping others to grow.

Focusing on impact enables us to reward engineers who ‚Äúget stuff done‚Äù without them needing to perform specific routines. We believe impact results from the combination of building technical skill, having the opportunity to demonstrate it, learning from that experience over time, and coupling it with important behaviours and core skills.

Excellence here looks like

- The work you choose to do drives team, discipline and business goals forward (relevant to the scope of your role).

- You proactively identify opportunities to further goals within engineering and bring clarity to opportunities in order to prioritise them.

- You ‚Äúget things done‚Äù. You work for the team, and are regarded as a highly effective contributor by your peers

#### Technical Skills

This aspect is about how you apply your technical skills and hone your craft and documents the type of behaviours that measure the effectiveness of an engineer‚Äôs technical contribution at different levels of complexity and ambiguity. Think of this as ‚Äúhow you do your work‚Äù.

Behaviours in this area should not detract engineers from doing what is most impactful for their team and Upp. This focuses on measuring technical contribution via quality, testability, performance and ability to design and critique designs. Your technical skills will gradually scale and improve with experience.

Excellence here looks like

- Your code and technical contribution are regarded as high quality by your peers and those above you in the framework.

- You can efficiently design systems to solve business problems, and can resolve ambiguity, both at the technical and product level.

- Your systems are designed with the appropriate level of complexity for the problem at hand. Your software is as simple as possible, but no simpler.

- Your work is resilient, well tested and scales to meet customer growth expectation

#### Behaviours

Behaviours are a collection of expectations and development areas for engineers, that do not fall into the categories of technical skill and impact. They encompass a range of core skills that we expect engineers at Upp to embody.

Through your behaviour you set an example to those around you. By modelling great behaviours you lead by example, and by being self-aware you know when you are setting a great example. Your behaviours show that you‚Äôre growing good habits, and cultivating qualities that make an excellent engineer, rather than unintentionally doing the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù by luck.

<!-- - Mastery - Your Upp knowledge and technical capability
- Influence - How you change the world around you for the better
- Comms & Feedback - How you interact with others
- Leadership - How people around you become better and more impactful -->

### Usage of the progression framework

#### How the framework should be used

The purpose of this document, and associated framework is to guide conversations around performance and progression between managers and engineers. This articulates the expectations of each broad level, the level of impact we expect individuals to bring to business problems, and the manner in which engineers should be conducting their work. This document is not designed to be useful as a standalone tool.

Progression from one (sub-) level to the next will be a conversation between the individual and their manager. To reiterate, this should not be seen as a checkbox exercise. Some individuals may move up a level without having experienced certain skills or behaviours, whilst also giving confidence that they‚Äôre meeting the level above. In other situations, a controlling weakness may prevent the individual moving forwards. The framework does not intend to codify every possible situation, instead laying out expectations in broad strokes.

For any promotion cases, managers and engineers will together need to be able to articulate clearly how the engineer has demonstrated the required impact for the level they are being promoted to and should have demonstrated experience in the related technical skill and behaviours in order to have that impact.

#### The Framework

The levels below represent a career‚Äôs worth of progression through engineering at Upp.

Levels are broadly cumulative, each one building on what comes before.

### Things to keep in mind

- There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Upp as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability, technical leadership and people management. All are equally valuable paths in Upp's engineering team.
- The framework represents a career‚Äôs worth of progression, people shouldn‚Äôt expect to fly up it in 18 months!
- Engineering progression isn‚Äôt an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.
- This isn‚Äôt a checklist ‚Äì it‚Äôs possible to progress up a level without showing all the behaviours in that level.
- There will be levels on top (eg ‚ÄòInventor of Android‚Äô or ‚ÄòAuthor of Go‚Äô), but we won‚Äôt add them until we need them.

### Give us your feedback!

This is perpetual work-in-progress and we really want your feedback.

We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.
