              This is where we keep the progression frameworks we use at Upp.
            </DescriptionText>
            <DescriptionText>
              Progression frameworks are tools that help us evaluate and pay our
              staff consistently, and help people understand how to progress in
              their work.
            </DescriptionText>
            <DescriptionText>
              We&apos;ve put them here for everyone at Upp (and anyone in the
              world!) to use.
            </DescriptionText>
            <DescriptionText>
              We&apos;ll be adding more frameworks as we build them, and
              updating existing ones as we grow, so expect things to change
              around here!

            <DescriptionText>
              This site, along with all our progression frameworks, are open
              source. That means you can contribute to the development of this
              site or our progression frameworks, and use both as inspiration
              for your own projects!

            <DescriptionText>

            <DescriptionText>
              Simplicity is not where you start, simplicity is where we are
              trying to get to (refactoring, abstracting, making it simple).

            <DescriptionText>
              The way we treat a core part of the system (orders, products,
              campaign stats services) vs a more experimental part should and
              will be different.
